## Overview of the analysis
W Avy, a key investor for my pilot project "Surf and Shake Shop" has requested temperature data for the month of June and December in Oahu so that he can determine whether my business is sustainable year-round. For this purpose, I have used tools such as Jupyter notebook, VS Studio and SQLite to analyize the data and come out with meaning full rsults, which can then be shared with his company's Board of Directors and SQlite database was used to make querries regarding the weather. 


## Results

After carrying out the necessary investigation, the following table was created for the month of December and June.

As can be seen from the analysis, the key differences in weather for June and December are mentioned below:
* The total number of entries for month of December is lower at 1517 as compared to June at 1700. 
* The minimum temperature for June at 64 degrees is almost 8 degrees higher than December minimum temp at 56 degrees. 
* When the review the 25%,50% and 75% values for both December annd June, it can be clearly visualized that the temps for June are comparitvely higher than December. 
* Although not much,standard deviation for the December is higher than month of June, hence December is expected to have more temp variation as compared to June. 

## Summary

Based on the results, it can be concluded that there is not a major temperature difference for the month of December and June, and the temperature is relatively moderate which further reinstates that Surfing and Icecream sales would be profitable business year round.  

Overall, the data shows minor differences beetween the temp for June and December and as expected June is slightly warmer than December. 

Further analysis of the precipitation levels for both months was carried out and the following tables were created:

Again it can bee seen that although the December has a higher standard dev (0.5414) and higher max values(6.42) as compared to June at std dev(0.3357) and max value (4.43), the precipitation levels are almost the same when we refer to 25, 50 and 75 quartile values. Thus it can be safely concluded that although December has more temp anad precipitation variation as compared to June, the temperatures and precipitation for both months are almost the same and favourable to Surfing and icecream sales.
