## Overview of the analysis
W Avy, a key investor for my pilot project "Surf and Shake Shop" has requested temperature data for the month of June and December in Oahu so that he can determine whether my business is sustainable year-round. For this purpose, I have used tools such as Jupyter notebook, VS Studio and SQLite to analyize the data and come out with meaning full rsults, which can then be shared with his company's Board of Directors. 


## Results
___
After carrying out the necessary investigation, the following table was created for the month of December and June.

As can be seen from the analysis, the key differences in weather for June and December are mentioned below:
* The total number of entries for month of December is lower at 1517 as compared to June at 1700. 
* The minimum temperature for June at 64 degrees is almost 8 degrees higher than December minimum temp at 56 degrees. 
* When the review the 25%,50% and 75% values for both December annd June, it can be clearly visualized that the temps for June are comparitvely higher than December. 
* Although not much,standard deviation for the December is higher than month of June, hence December is expected to have more temp variation as compared to June. 

## Summary
___
Based on the results, it can be concluded that there is not a major difference in mean temp for both June(74.94) and December(71.04), although if you review all the parameters suuch as 25%%, 50% and 75% quartile figures, it can be seen that the temperature in December lower when compared to June. Further analysisi of the precipitation leevels was carried out and thhe following tables were created:
